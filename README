MultiEdit is a plugin originally created for version 1.8 of Qgis. 
This plugin let the user choose an attribute value from a vector layer and selecting the matching features, 
allows the user change all the corresponding to a new value.
It is particurarly useful if you have many features to modify assigning the same value or if you have the necessity 
to write the same value to a new field in the table of attributes of your vector layer wherever there's a matching feature 
to your criterion: this plugin lets you write the new value in any existing field in the attribute table, 
for the selected features or in any other newly created fields directly from the plugin gui.
This branch is intended to be the future developing ground and at the moment is compatible with 3.x version of Qgis.
